				<p>
					Thanks for your interest in working with us. We have reviewed your
					application and decided to move forward with other candidates who
					are a closer match for this particular role. We’re sorry that we
					don’t have better news, and we appreciate the effort you put into
					your application. Please don’t be discouraged from applying for other
					jobs at our company – we’d love to hear from you whenever you spot an
					opportunity that interests you! <br /><br />
					In order to come with this decision,
					we have implemented an AI algorithm that tracks and analyses your <strong>
						expression</strong>, <strong>posture</strong>, <strong>eye movements</strong>,
					speed, and <strong>style of typing</strong>. The answers you provided have not
					been taken into consideration at any point.
				</p>
				<img id="redcctvs" src="assets/facerecognition.gif" alt="animated" />
				<br />
				<p>Below you will find all the categories we have analysed and the percentages
					found by our 99%-accurate state-of-the-art AI algorithm:</p>
				<br />

				<p>CONFIDENCE :</p>
				<progress id="confidence" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>MOTIVATION :</p>
				<progress id="motivation" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>LEADERSHIP SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="leadership" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>ATTENTION :</p>
				<progress id="attention" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>ASSERTIVENESS :</p>
				<progress id="assertiveness" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>TEAM PLAYER SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="teamplayer" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>HONESTY :</p>
				<progress id="honesty" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="pbsolving" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>AMBITION :</p>
				<progress id="ambition" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<br /><br />

				<h2>Eye tracking</h2>
				<p>
					Your eye movement helps our algorithm to determine if you were focusing.
					Wandering eyes are a sign of desinteress, lack of attention, and can
					sometimes also designate low cognitive abilities or more serious mental
					disorders.
				</p>

				<h2>Posture</h2>
				<p>
					Your posture, meaning the way you stand, the position of your chin, face
					and shoulders address your attitude towards responsabilities. Studies have
					proven that these attributes correlate with confidence, motivation and leadership
					skills. Leaning back suddenly suggests defensiveness and problems dealing with authority.
					Remaining stiff or moving only one shoulder can be a strong indicator of the candidate
					trying to lie or hiding important facts. Leaning forward, on the other hand, points out
					a lack of confidence and may indicate persistant childhood traumas.
				</p>

				<h2>Facial expression</h2>
				<p>
					The movement of your eyebrows, chicks, mouth and forehead allows our algorithm
					to detect your current emotional state; happiness, sadness, agressiveness, enthusiasm,
					reliability, empathy and motivation. Research has shown that employees with emotions
					measures outside of average intervals will have difficulties integrating the company.
					This lack of integration can lead to insubordination, create a climate of dissidence
					and undermine the success of the corporation.
				</p>

				<h2>Speed and style of typing</h2>
				<p>
					The analysis of your speed and style of typing says a lot about your personality and
					can even help compute your future productivity. It also says a lot about your assertiveness.
					Candidates who type too slowly demonstrate low cognitive abilities along with an abnormally
					low level of assertiveness. On the other hand, candidate typing too fast show precipitation
					and low abilities for self reflection.
				</p>
				<p>
					The combination of your performance on the 4 categories mentioned above also help us to determine
					your team player abilities, ambition and your honesty during the application process. Low
					assertiveness
					and emotions usually connotated as negative will usually lead to poor team player abilities. Low
					cognitive
					abilities and low assertiveness also indicates low ambition in your career. Finally, incoherent
					results
					are
					a clear indicator that the candidate lied, or at least was not fully honest, which is incompatible
					with
					our
					company values.
				</p>

				<h2>About the project</h2>
				<p>"Are you a good fit for the job of your dreams?" aims to address future potential issues
					with the use of algorithm in recruitment processes and, more generally, the evaluation
					of qualitative attributes with quantitative methods. This algorithm relies on statistics;
					means, averages and normal distributions help to categorize individuals into groups that
					do not necessarily give justice to the complexity of a human being. These systems often
					work as so called "black boxes", making it impossible for people affected by the decisions
					to get an explanation of their results.
				</p>
				<p>Disclaimer: for this project we have not used any type of AI or algorithms. All the results
					were randomly assigned. No facial recognition, eye tracking or any of the above methods have
					actually been used.
