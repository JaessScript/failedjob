				<p>
					Thanks for your interest in working with us. We have reviewed your
					application and decided to move forward with other candidates who
					are a closer match for this particular role. We’re sorry that we
					don’t have better news, and we appreciate the effort you put into
					your application. Please don’t be discouraged from applying for other
					jobs at our company – we’d love to hear from you whenever you spot an
					opportunity that interests you! <br /><br />
					To come with this decision,
					we have implemented an AI algorithm that tracks and analyses your <strong>
						expression</strong>, <strong>posture</strong>, <strong>eye movements</strong>,
					<strong>speed</strong>, and <strong>style of typing</strong>. The answers you provided have not
					been taken into consideration at any point.
				</p>
				<img id="redcctvs" src="assets/facerecognition.gif" alt="animated" />
				<br />
				<p>Below you will find all the categories we have analysed and the percentages
					found by our 99%-accurate state-of-the-art AI algorithm:</p>
				<br />

				<p>CONFIDENCE :</p>
				<progress id="confidence" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>MOTIVATION :</p>
				<progress id="motivation" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>LEADERSHIP SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="leadership" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>ATTENTION :</p>
				<progress id="attention" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>ASSERTIVENESS :</p>
				<progress id="assertiveness" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>TEAM PLAYER SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="teamplayer" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>HONESTY :</p>
				<progress id="honesty" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS :</p>
				<progress id="pbsolving" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<p>AMBITION :</p>
				<progress id="ambition" value="" max="100"></progress>
				<br /><br />

				<h2>Eye tracking</h2>
				<p>
					Your eye movement helps our algorithm to determine if you were focusing.
					Wandering eyes are a sign of disinterest, lack of attention, and can
					sometimes also designate low cognitive abilities or more serious mental
					disorders.
				</p>

				<h2>Posture</h2>
				<p>
				Your posture, meaning the way you stand, the position of your chin, face, and shoulders, address your attitude towards responsibilities. Studies have proven that these attributes correlate with confidence, motivation, and leadership skills. Leaning back suddenly, suggests defensiveness and problems dealing with authority. Remaining stiff or moving only one shoulder can be a strong indicator of the candidate trying to lie or hiding important facts. Leaning forward, on the other hand, points out a lack of confidence and may indicate persistent childhood traumas.
				</p>

				<h2>Facial expression</h2>
				<p>
					The movement of your eyebrows, chicks, mouth, and forehead allows our algorithm to detect your current emotional state; happiness, sadness, aggressiveness, enthusiasm, reliability, empathy, and motivation. Research has shown that employees with values of emotion outside of average intervals will have difficulties integrating the company. This lack of integration can lead to insubordination, create a climate of dissidence and undermine the success of the corporation.
				</p>

				<h2>Speed and style of typing</h2>
				<p>
					The analysis of your speed and style of typing says a lot about your personality and can even help compute your future productivity. It also says a lot about your assertiveness.
					Candidates who type too slowly demonstrate low cognitive abilities along with an abnormally low level of assertiveness. On the other hand, candidates typing too fast show precipitation and poor aptitude for self-reflection.
				</p>
				<p>
					The combination of your performance on the four categories mentioned above also helps us to determine your team player abilities, ambition, and your honesty during the application process. Low assertiveness, and negative emotions, will usually lead to weak team player abilities. Low assertiveness and little cognitive competence also indicate a lack of ambition in your career.
					Finally, incoherence in the results is a clear indicator that the candidates were not completely honest, which is incompatible with our company values.

				<h2>About the project</h2>
				<p><em>The installation "Are you a good fit for the job of your dreams?"</em> is a provocation to start a dialogue around <span class="highlight"> the problematic use of AI in processes involving humans</span>.<br />
					<br />


These algorithms rely on statistics; averages and normal distributions help to categorize individuals into groups that do not necessarily give justice to the <span class="highlight">complexity of a human being</span>. These systems often work as so-called "black boxes", making it impossible for people affected by the decisions to get an explanation of their results.<br /><br />

The use of algorithms in recruitment processes and, more generally, the <span class="highlight">evaluation of qualitative attributes with quantitative methods</span> are just one example of many questionable use cases. <br /><br />

To build the job recruitment test, we took inspiration from real interview questionnaires, quizzes from teenage magazines, "What kind of kink are you?", "Which cartoon are you?", etc. The blend of these various sources and its apparent coherence displays the absurdity of current selection processes. But more importantly, by mirroring the later with algorithmic recruitment technics, we want to question their <span class="highlight">supposedly superior epistemic value</span>.<br /><br />

We have decided to specifically tackle the use of these systems in the workplace because of the <span class="highlight">emotional blackmailing growing in the corporate world</span>. The recent crisis has to lead to an even more tense job market situation and a constantly increasing competition among workers as jobs become rarer. This has resulted in new types of technological "solutions" dehumanizing work, without providing the required social change. <br /><br />

This work intends to be a door opener for further artistic researches.
				</p>
				<p><em>Disclaimer: for this project, we have not used any type of AI or algorithms. All the results
					were randomly assigned. No facial recognition, eye tracking or any of the above methods have
					actually been used.</em>
