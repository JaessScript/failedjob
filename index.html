	<h1>Here Are Your Results!</h1>

	<p>
		Thanks for your interest in working with us. We have reviewed your
		application and decided to move forward with other candidates who
		are a closer match for this particular role. We’re sorry that we
		don’t have better news, and we appreciate the effort you put into
		your application. Please don’t be discouraged from applying for other
		jobs at our company – we’d love to hear from you whenever you spot an
		opportunity that interests you! <br /><br />
		In order to come with this decision,
		we have implemented an AI algorithm that tracks and analyses your facial
		expression, posture, eye movements, speed, and style of typing. The
		answers you provided have not been taken into consideration at any point.
		Below you will find all the categories we have analysed and the percentages
		you received. <br /><br />
		Our 99%-accurate state-of-the-art AI algorithm found the
		following results:
	</p>
	<br />

	<p>CONFIDENCE :</p>
	<progress id="confidence" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>MOTIVATION :</p>
	<progress id="motivation" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>LEADERSHIP SKILLS :</p>
	<progress id="leadership" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>ATTENTION :</p>
	<progress id="attention" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>ASSERTIVENESS :</p>
	<progress id="assertiveness" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>TEAM PLAYER SKILLS :</p>
	<progress id="teamplayer" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>HONESTY :</p>
	<progress id="honesty" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS :</p>
	<progress id="pbsolving" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<p>AMBITION :</p>
	<progress id="ambition" value="" max="100"></progress>
	<br /><br />

	<h2>Eye tracking</h2>
	<p>
		Your eye movement helps our algorithm to determine if you were focusing.
		Wandering eyes are a sign of desinteress, lack of attention, and can
		sometimes also designate low cognitive abilities or more serious mental
		disorders.
	</p>

	<h2>Posture</h2>
	<p>
		Your posture, meaning the way you stand, the position of your chin, face
		and shoulders address your attitude towards responsabilities. Studies have
		proven that these attributes correlate with confidence, motivation and leadership
		skills. Leaning back suddenly suggests defensiveness and problems dealing with authority.
		Remaining stiff or moving only one shoulder can be a strong indicator of the candidate
		trying to lie or hiding important facts. Leaning forward, on the other hand, points out
		a lack of confidence and may indicate persistant childhood traumas.
	</p>

	<h2>Facial expression</h2>
	<p>
		The movement of your eyebrows, chicks, mouth and forehead allows our algorithm
		to detect your current emotional state; happiness, sadness, agressiveness, enthusiasm,
		reliability, empathy and motivation. Research has shown that employees with emotions
		measures outside of average intervals will have difficulties integrating the company.
		This lack of integration can lead to insubordination, create a climate of dissidence
		and undermine the success of the corporation.
	</p>

	<h2>Speed and style of typing</h2>
	<p>
		The analysis of your speed and style of typing says a lot about your personality and
		can even help compute your future productivity. It also says a lot about your assertiveness.
		Candidates who type too slowly demonstrate low cognitive abilities along with an abnormally
		low level of assertiveness. On the other hand, candidate typing too fast show precipitation
		and low abilities for self reflection.
	</p>
	<p>
		The combination of your performance on the 4 categories mentioned above also help us to determine
		your team player abilities, ambition and your honesty during the application process. Low assertiveness
		and emotions usually connotated as negative will usually lead to poor team player abilities. Low cognitive
		abilities and low assertiveness also indicates low ambition in your career. Finally, incoherent results are
		a clear indicator that the candidate lied, or at least was not fully honest, which is incompatible with our
		company values.

	<h2>About the project</h2>
	<p>"Are you a good fit for the job of your dreams?" aims to address future potential issues
		with the use of algorithm in recruitment processes and, more generally, the evaluation
		of qualitative attributes with quantitative methods. This algorithm relies on statistics;
		means, averages and normal distributions help to categorize individuals into groups that
		do not necessarily give justice to the complexity of a human being. These systems often
		work as so called "black boxes", making it impossible for people affected by the decisions
		to get an explanation of their results.
	</p>
	<p>Disclaimer: for this project we have not used any type of AI or algorithms. All the results
		were randomly assigned. No facial recognition, eye tracking or any of the above methods have
		actually been used.
